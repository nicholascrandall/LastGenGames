Last Gen Games is an online store where you can buy and sell older video games.  We also have a merchandise section where you can purchase mugs, shirts, and controllers.  All registered users have a unique profile page that they can edit and share with friends!

##User Stories
* Users can register an account on our site and use it to log in.
* Users can rest easy knowing their passwords are hashed and salted.
* Users can view an index of video games.
* Inside this index, users can edit, delete, and add a new game at whatever price they want to list it.
* Users can buy games directly from this page, or click on a link to visit a page dedicated to that game with further information.
* Users can also view our store Merchandise
* Merchandise cannot be edited, deleted, or added by users, but it can be purchased directly from our index or through each item's show page.
* Upon account registration, a unique profile is automatically created for every user.
* Users can view their profile by clicking the "Profile" link in the navigation bar.
* User profiles by default contain a gender neutral non identifying stock photo as well as a blank "about me" section
* Users can edit their profiles to add text to the about me section and change the picture via URL to any image on the internet.
* If users have a locally stored picture they'd like to use, it's recommended to upload it to a free image hosting site such as Imgur, and then link our site to the hosted URL.

##Unsolved Problems/Things to implement
* Direct image uploading is not yet implemented
* The ability to rate or add comments to games or merchandise is not yet implemented
* Currently, store items are NOT tied to the user that created them, so anyone can edit or delete any Game from the store :)
* Would like to add saved shipping information and paypal integration to profiles that only that user can see.
* A shopping cart/proper checkout is not yet implemented.
